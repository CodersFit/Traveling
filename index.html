    <div class="pass1">CORY PASS – MT. EDITH CIRCUIT</div>
    <div class="pass2">This incredible hike through Edith and Cory Passes is the most varied hike close to Banff. This circuit takes in a number of different micro ecosystems – from a steep and dry ridge, to an arid pass, back through a lush forest. Be aware of some modest scrambling sections (both up and down) on the approach to Cory Pass.<br>
      <br>The hike to Cory Pass requires some serious leg power, but the view from the pass is one of the most spectacular and rewarding in all of Banff National Park. The sheer south face of Mt. Louis surprises hikers as they crest the pass – a great place to sit and enjoy a packed lunch. Continue the circuit upon reaching the pass by descending down the other side and around Mt. Edith (a bit easier on the legs), or return the way you came. <br><br>Distance: 13 km (8 mi.) loop
<br>Elevation gain: 1000 m (3280 ft)
<br>Time required: 5-6 hours
Difficulty: Challenging</div>

    <div class="canyon1">Kings Canyon</div>
    <div class="canyon2">The iconic hike to the top of Kings Canyon is known as the spellbinding Rim Walk. The Rim Walk will take you on a 6 kilometre circuit transcending down into the Garden of Eden and back to the top to wonder at the 360 views. Depending on what pace you take to absorb the humbling scenery, the walk can take around 3-4 hours. 
<br><br>
The start of the walk is the most difficult, with around 500 steep steps to climb – once you are up there it will be one of the most magical experiences of your life. After you take in the views from the top of the stairs, continue your journey through Priscilla’s Crack made famous by the classic Australian movie Priscilla Queen of the Desert and to the first lookout across the canyon. 
From there you will see the marvelous sandstone domes (a mini-Purnululu) known as the Lost City due to it resembling an ancient city. 
<br><br>
The best time to take on this experience is during sunrise as the sun slowly reflections onto the sandstone turning a stunning array of oranges and reds.</div>

    <div class="new1">Tongariro Alpine Crossing</div>
    <div class="new2">The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is heralded as the best one-day trek in New Zealand and is regarded as among the top ten single-day treks in the world.
<br><br>
Many who complete the 19.4 km (12 mile) journey will tell you the climbs can be steep and the weather unpredictable, though worth it in every aspect. The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is located in the Tongariro National Park - New Zealand's oldest national park and a dual UNESCO World Heritage Site.
<br><br>
Tongariro National Park is rich in both cultural identity and dramatic, awe-inspiring natural scenery. Unique landforms, including the volcanic peaks of Ngauruhoe, Tongariro and Ruapehu ensure the Tongariro Alpine Crossing is considered a world-renowned trek.<br>
<br>Distance: 20 km (12.4 miles) point-to-point
<br>Difficulty: Strenuous
<br>Length of Time: 6 to 8 hours</div>

    <div class="dolo1">Puez-Odle Altopiano</div>
    <div class="dolo2">The Puez-Odle Altopiano is a spectacular hike from start to finish. With jaw-dropping views of the Dolomites, fields of wildflowers, and endless alpine views, this is our favorite hike in the Dolomites.<br><br>
The Puez-Odle hike is a 9 mile hike along some of the highest mountain peaks in the Dolomites.  The hike involves 500 meters of climbing (a chairlift shaves 700m off the first ascent) and 1150 meters of descent.  The length of the hike and the amount of climbing were just enough to make it challenging, and the views are what really kept it interesting. <br>
<br>Distance: 9 miles/14.5 km
<br>Elevation Gain: 500 meters ascent/1100 meters descent
<br>Time: 6 – 7 hours
<br>Difficulty: Moderate</div>

    <div class="wall1">Great Wall of China</div>
    <div class="wall2">This is the most classic hiking route on the Great Wall, taking about 5 hours to complete a distance of 10 km (6 miles) from Jiankou section to Mutianyu section. Challenge the most precipitous Jiankou section of the Great Wall, wild, weathered and primitive. <br><br>Photographers and hikers love this section, which is also the iconic image of the Great Wall as you can see in many photo albums. Mutianyu section of the Great Wall boasts the most beautiful scenery of all the sections. It is restored and tourist-friendly. Hiking the whole route is like traveling through time from primitive to modern, presenting three phases of the Great Wall with striking contrast from wild, half-repaired to totally repaired. <br>
    <br>Distance: 6.73 km (4.2 miles)
<br>Starting Elevation: 625 meters (2,050 feet)

      <div class="machu1">Inca Trail</div>
      <div class="machu2">The Inca Trail, or the Camino del Inca, is one of the most important features of South America’s past and present, and the trek to Machu Picchu is unlike any other adventure in the world. There are very few trails where you can actually walk through history like this. On this adventure, you will continuously encounter 500-year-old Incan archaeological sites, and at the end of the trek, you receive a great reward as you ascend the Sun Gate and reach the legendary Machu Picchu site.<br><br>
The high-altitude ruins of Machu Picchu are located on a mountain ridge 7,972 feet above sea level at the end of the Classic Inca Trail Route, in the Urubamba Province of Southern Peru.
<br><br>
Known as one of the ‘New Seven Wonders of the World’ and officially recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, there are plenty of excellent reasons to visit Machu Picchu at least once! As the most widely recognized surviving symbol of the Inca Empire and one of the most important archeological sites discovered on Earth, this Andean landmark is guaranteed to excite even the most experienced adventurer.</div>
